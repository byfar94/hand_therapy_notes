# CMC Suspensioplast with APL graft

## procdure outline

With the trapezium excised, a slip of the APL is routed through the drill holes in the 1st
metacarpal and sutured to the FCR.

## splint

Thumb spica

## return to activities

- light activities 6 weeks
- Normal activities 3-4 months
- sporting activities 5-6 months

## protocol

#### 10 -14 days

AROM exercises are initiated for the wrist, digits and thumb IP joint 3-4 times a day for 5-10 minute
sessions.

#### 3 weeks

AROM exercises may be initiated to the MPJ, while stabilizing the first metacarpal/ CMC joint

#### 4 weeks

- Thumb flexion, extension and palmar abduction
- Thumb circumduction (clockwise/counter-clockwise)
- Lightly touching each finger with the thumb
- It is important to emphasize avoiding movement patterns such as lateral pinch, adduction of the thumb
  against the index finger and wide radial abduction. This will avoid overstretching of the LTRI and
  accentuating the deforming forces that generated instability.

#### 5 weeks

PROM exercises are added to the MPJ and IPJ of the thumb, with the CMC joint supported (manually or
with an orthosis).

#### 6 weeks

- Add isometric resistance for the APB/opponens.
- On rare occasion, it becomes necessary to add a custom-fabricated dynamic flexion orthosis for the
  MP and IP joint of the thumb.
- Wean off splint DT over the course of 2 weeks
- Continue NT splinting for 8 -12 weeks

#### 8 weeks

Gentle strengthening may be initiated when the patient reports concerns for hand and thumb strength.
Soft putty can help build endurance in the hand. [Note: The preferred method for recapturing hand
and thumb strength is through normal daily activity versus a focus on using putty or a hand exerciser.]

#### 10 - 12 weeks

- The patient may gradually resume normal use of their hand in all daily activity.
- Patient education is important. The basic guidelines outlined in conservative management of CMC
  arthritis should be reviewed once again.
- Wean off NT orthosis

## complications

- The inability to flatten the palm after the procedure is typical. Often this is a concern to the patient.
  Activities such as cleaning the windows, wiping down a countertop, holding a wide diameter drinking
  glass etc. can be frustrating. Patients need to understand this is to be expected to a certain degree
  because this positioning is maintaining stability of the CMC joint.
